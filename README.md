XKSystem
========

Introduction
=============
This is the main project of me for Object-Oriented Technology (OOT) course taught by teacher Tiange Zhang(course teacher) in <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn">Fudan University</a>. The main goal is to implement a college course elective system using OOT. Students like me should complete the domain model and implement it with JAVA, mainly using Hibernate for mapping database.

How to use?
============
Clone the project and import it into you Eclipse (Spring Tools Suite is recommended). Since the project only contains hibernate mapping classes and some background controllers for business logic, we chose junit for testing.
