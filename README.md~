Introduction
=============
This is the main project of me for Object-Oriented Technology (OOT) course taught by teacher Tiange Zhang in <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn">Fudan University</a>. The main goal is to implement a college course elective system using OOT. Students like me should complete the domain model and implement it with JAVA, mainly using Hibernate for mapping database.
